        In order to help the development and dissemination of different science
        education initiatives Scientix has set up the Scientix Observatory which
        provides overviews on the state of play of different topics related to
        science education (www.scientix.eu/web/guest/observatory). The
        observatory of Scientix provides short synthesising articles, focused on
        one or several related themes or initiatives, or the state of play of
        different topics related to science education.

        The STEM Education Practices in Europe report draws on the analysis of
        3,780 responses (representing over 4,500 classes) to the STEM Education
        Practices Survey, answered by educators in 38 European countries. Its
        aim is to provide a grassroots, European-wide perspective on how STEM
        teachers organise their teaching, in terms of resources and pedagogical
        approaches used, on the current state of teachers’ professional
        development and support, and on their opinions and attitudes,
        particularly in relation to their school environment and their openness
        to cooperation with STEM industries.

        Teachers’ responses analysed in a new Scientix Observatory report. The
        data that is presented in a new Scientix Observatory report shows that
        teachers of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) need
        more support, training and tools for implementing innovative pedagogies
        at schools. This report is based on an analysis of 3,780 responses from
        STEM teachers at secondary schools in 38 European countries to a survey
        carried out by Scientix, with the support of European Schoolnet and
        Texas Instruments, earlier this year.

        Studies funded by the European Commission or conducted by Science,
        Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) communities such as the
        STEM Alliance have highlighted major issues regarding the situation of
        STEM in European education systems: the low attractiveness of STEM
        studies and careers, or the unmet labour-market needs in STEM-related
        sectors that are expected to grow in the future.

      <p>
        STEM Integration in K-12 Education examines current efforts to connect
        the STEM disciplines in K-12 education. This report identifies and
        characterizes existing approaches to integrated STEM education, both in
        formal and after- and out-of-school settings. The report reviews the
        evidence for the impact of integrated approaches on various student
        outcomes, and it proposes a set of priority research questions to
        advance the understanding of integrated STEM education. STEM Integration
        in K-12 Education proposes a framework to provide a common perspective
        and vocabulary for researchers, practitioners, and others to identify,
        discuss, and investigate specific integrated STEM initiatives within the
        K-12 education system of the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        STEM Integration in K-12 Education makes recommendations for designers
        of integrated STEM experiences, assessment developers, and researchers
        to design and document effective integrated STEM education. This report
        will help to further their work and improve the chances that some forms
        of integrated STEM education will make a positive difference in student
        learning and interest and other valued outcomes.

        With the STEM School Label, school representatives will be able to
        evaluate their school via an online self-assessment tool according to
        the criteria defining a STEM School. This self-assessment tool will
        identify required areas of development and provide training as well as
        resources for applicant schools to improve their STEM activities at the
        school level.

        European Schoolnet is the network of 34 European Ministries of
        Education, based in Brussels. As a not-for-profit organisation, we aim
        to bring innovation in teaching and learning to our key stakeholders:
        <b>
          Ministries of Education, schools, teachers, researchers, and industry
          partners.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        European Schoolnet is at the forefront of the debate on how to attract
        more people to science and technology to address the future skills gap
        that Europe is facing. STEM is one of European Schoolnet's major
        thematic domains. We have been involved in more than 30 STEM education
        initiatives, financed through European Schoolnet's Ministry of Education
        members, industry partners, or by the European Union's funding
        programmes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The portfolio of European Schoolnet STEM projects ranges from teacher
        training (Amgen Teach) to technology-enhanced learning (Next-Lab), and
        science awareness for schools (Space Awareness).
      </p>
      <p>
        European Schoolnet is also leading the work of two strategic initiatives
        in science and mathematics education in Europe: STEM Alliance and
